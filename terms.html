    <h2 id="section1">1. Accounts</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding your account information. You agree to provide accurate and complete information when creating an account and to keep this information up to date. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

    <h2 id="section2">2. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <h3>a) Your Responsibility</h3>
    <p>You are solely responsible for any content you create, save, upload, or post within the App, including saved prompts, shared prompts, audio files uploaded for analysis, and comments ("User Content"). You agree not to post User Content that is unlawful, offensive, or violates the rights of others.</p>

    <h3>b) License You Grant Us</h3>
    <p>By posting User Content to the public areas of the App (such as the community feature), you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, reproduce, and distribute your User Content in connection with operating and promoting the App. <strong>Note: This license does not apply to audio files uploaded for private analysis, which are handled as described in Section 4.</strong></p>

    <h3>c) Content Moderation</h3>
    <p>We do not pre-screen User Content, but we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to remove or disable access to any User Content that we believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful.</p>

    <h2 id="section3">3. AI Services & Generated Content</h2>
    <h3>a) Third-Party AI Services</h3>
    <p>The App utilizes third-party artificial intelligence services (including but not limited to Google Gemini and Vertex AI) to generate lyrics, reports, and analyze data. Your use of these features is subject to the availability of these third-party services.</p>

    <h3>b) Accuracy of AI Output</h3>
    <p>AI-generated content (lyrics, director reports, titles, etc.) is probabilistic and may be inaccurate, offensive, or hallucinated. The App does not guarantee the accuracy, uniqueness, or quality of AI-generated results. You should verify all information independently.</p>

    <h3>c) Ownership of AI Content</h3>
    <p>Subject to the terms of the third-party AI providers, you generally own the rights to the prompts you input and the content generated specifically for you, provided you comply with these Terms. However, we claim no ownership over the AI-generated outputs.</p>

    <h2 id="section4">4. Audio Analysis & Data Handling</h2>
    <h3>a) Temporary Processing</h3>
    <p>The "Audio Analysis" feature allows you to upload audio files for style and mood analysis. <strong>These files are processed transiently for the sole purpose of analysis and are NOT permanently stored on our servers.</strong> Once the analysis is complete, the audio data is discarded from memory.</p>

    <h3>b) Copyright & Fair Use</h3>
    <p>You represent and warrant that you own the copyright to any audio file you upload or have the necessary legal rights to use it for analysis. You agree not to upload copyrighted music owned by others without permission. The App disclaims all liability for copyright infringement resulting from your use of the Audio Analysis feature.</p>

    <h2 id="section5">5. Prohibited Use</h2>

        <li>Soliciting others to perform or participate in unlawful acts.</li>
        <li>Harassing, abusing, or harming another person.</li>
        <li>Uploading audio files containing illegal content or content that infringes on intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li>Using the AI features to generate hate speech, sexually explicit content, or content that promotes violence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="section6">6. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of these Terms. Examples of conduct that may lead to termination include posting inappropriate content, spamming, or harassment of other users.</p>

    <h2 id="section7">7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Your use of the App is at your sole risk.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Disclaimer:</strong> We do not warrant that AI-generated results will meet your requirements or be free from errors.</li>
